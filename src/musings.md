* categorical Sets and ZFC sets aren't precisely the same, and there is a
  directed effort to distinguish them once we get to topos. however, it's
  unclear what kinds of potholes one gets into if one naively makes the
  presumption that one can treat ZFC sets and categorical sets interchangably.

* how does a 'collection' differ from a 'set'
  at times, a 'collection of objects' is used interchangly with 'set of objects'
  i know that collection means 'stuff without associated morphisms'
  i get the sense in which collection <-> set is fine to use here because
  all objects are defined to have id by default categorically. but it would
  be nice to understand exactly how they differ.

* why is the hom functor a profunctor?

* what's a comma category? more broadly, what is the right abstraction for
  thinking about how exactly to find the category in which a universal
  construction is identified?
