this chapter has no exercises; however it focuses on the function type, and
eventually, the curry howard isomorphism.

the fact that the previous chapters have had their exercises be done natively
in idris2 directly showcases this notion.

if you're reading this in the future. i hope this has inspired you to pick
up a dependently typed language off the shelf (i like idris), and try
to do these exercises yourself.
